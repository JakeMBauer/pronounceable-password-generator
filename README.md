Want pronounceable passwords that aren't real words?  This is for you!

# gpw-js #

It's recently [come to people's attention][xkcd] that long pass*phrases* of
multiple words are better than short pass*words* that are hard to remember.  As
a result, [there are][xkcd-generator] passphrase generators that string
together a number of words.

However, this approach still allows dictionary attacks.  If you [use uncommon
words][ppg], it's better, but I still like to use words that don't actually
exist.  It's still important to have things my brain *thinks* are words,
though, because "words" I can pronounce are easier to remember than strings of
random characters.

The backend is written by [Tom Van Vleck][tvv], based on work by Morrie Gasser.
In addition to [this Javascript version][gpw-js], he has written made it
available [in Java][gpw-java], [in C][gpw-c], and [for iOS][gpw-ios].
